A GUI Program written in C++,Qt that solves a sudoku.
The Sudoku is solved by viewing it as a exact cover problem(https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exact_cover).
One of the fastest algorithms of solving the exact cover problem is Knuth's Algorithm X(https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Knuth%27s_Algorithm_X)
The DLX data structure files are in DLX folder(duh).

To build the program just run qmake SudokuSolver.pro then make -f Makefile
